# Patient Journey with ChatGPT
This repo will replicate my existing [graph-based patient journey analysis](https://github.com/danb-neo4j/patient_journey), but will incorporate ChatGPT via the Python API. The objective is to demonstrate how ChatGPT (or other LLMs) can enhance exploratory data analysis, graph data model development, graph exploratory data analysis, and the patient journey analysis itself. This will include graph and non-graph elements of the workflow. 

## Notebooks:
**[Tabluar EDA](https://github.com/danb-neo4j/patient_journey_chatGPT/blob/main/patientJourney_tabularEDA_chatGPT.ipynb):** In this notebook I perform a traditional exploratory data analysis on the four data sources include in the Neo4j graph. However, throughout the process I incorporate ChatGPT to identify important features, evaluate statistical distributions, and suggest potential graph data models. 


*Note: This repo is a work in progress as of May 10, 2023. Additional notebooks will be added as they are completed.*
